# sanity_project (Resource)

Provides a Sanity project. A project is the base resource for creating content, and the project may contain datasets, CORS origins, and tags.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "sanity_project" "main" {
  name        = "Test project"
  studio_host = "my-test-project"
  color       = "#0000ff"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `activity_feed_enabled` (Boolean) Indicates whether the [activity feed](https://www.sanity.io/docs/activity-feed) is enabled. Defaults to `true`.
- `color` (String) The hex value for the project color. This is the color of the project icon at https://sanity.io/manage.
- `disabled_by_user` (Boolean) Indicates whether the project is archived. Defaults to `false`.
- `external_studio_host` (String) The external studio host URL.
- `name` (String) The project name.
- `organization` (String) The name of the organization that owns the project.
- `studio_host` (String) The studio host URL. This attribute exhibits two unique behaviors that are important to note. First, once the studio host URL is set, it may not be changed. Changing this value will force a replacement. Second, when the studio host is set, Sanity will automatically create a CORS entry for the studio host URL. This means that it is not necessary for you to create a CORS entry, and you will get a conflict error if you do.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The project ID, which you can find at the top of the project page in Sanity.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# import using the project ID, which can be found 
# on the project page under https://sanity.io/manage
terraform import sanity_project.default project-id
```
