# Sanity Terraform Provider

The Sanity Terraform Provider allows you to configure and update CMS resources for [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/).

## Setup

### Authentication

The provider requires an authentication token used to communicate with Sanity APIs. You can use a token created as part of a project, or you can use the auth token created when you sign in to the Sanity CLI. To get your auth token you can run `sanity debug --secrets` at a command prompt.

```terraform
provider "sanity" {
  token = var.sanity_auth_token
}
```

However, it is best to not store the token in plain text. Instead, you can set an environment variable `SANITY_TOKEN` with the auth token, and then you can omit the `token` from the provider block:

```terraform
provider "sanity" {}
```
